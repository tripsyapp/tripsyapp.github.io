          <li>Now, all users can scroll into the list of activities of premium itineraries;</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug when the app is not showing the seat number and seat class information;</li>

      </p>

      <p id="1.1.0">
        <strong>1.1.0 — Jan 18, 2018</strong>
        <p>Traveling is creating stories, saving moments, and of course getting enthusiastic about the next destination.</p>
        <p>Who does not like to pack, start preparing a script, or even make the list of trips already made? These feelings are common among us, travelers​.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, we have created a way to organize your travels just as they are part of your life. Now, you can view your next trip separately, the future ones and the ones that have already happened.</p>
        <p>Also, in our last few trips, we realized that navigating between various transport or map applications and adding their destination to each one is not an easy task. Now tapping on any address added in Tripsy will give you service options like Lyft, Uber, CityMapper, Waze and Google Maps.</p>
        <p>So, have you decided on your next destination? In this version we added an incredible script for Santiago, lasting 5 days, but you can always extend or reduce it according to your preference.</p>
        <p>Besides, of course, we have made several bug fixes and usability improvements in the application.</p>
        <p>We hope you enjoy this update! Any questions or feedback can be sent directly to <a href="mailto:feedback@tripsy.app">feedback@tripsy.app</a>.</p>
        <p>Thank you and a great trip!</p>
      </p>
